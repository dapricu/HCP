      <h2>2038</h2>
      <h3>Rio Pardo, Brazil</h3>
      <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/2098377.jpg">
      <p align="justify"> <br> Life had never been kind to Leticia and Lucas. Living in Rio Pardo, a small town in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, 100 kilometers upriver from Porto Alegre, required constant efforts. Since the coronavirus crisis in Brazil there had been an urban exodus, similar to the one promoted by the Industrial Revolution, but in reverse. The population of the cities migrated to the interior, to small rural populations in search of peace and self-sufficiency, and Leticia and Lucas were not different in this regard. However, the field and artisanal work they carried out, although always comforting for the soul and despite its virtuosity, was not enough for great economic boasts.
      </p><p align="justify"> <br> It was in these conditions that Sphyrna was born. In a poor and ramshackle house on the outskirts of a small town in Brazil, under the protection of his parents, Leti and Lucas, poor and ramshackle themselves, and his grandmother Leo, poorer still, and much more ramshackle, but close to all, kind to everyone and essentially good.

      <h3>First years</h3>

      <p align="justify"> <br> Leti and Lucas broke their spines so that Sphyrna never lacked anything, and they achieved it. Loving and caring, he was always a strong and healthy boy, and he grew quickly, always a head taller than the other children. His grandma Leo took care of his education, as good as the old woman could. Colors, numbers, reading and writing ... Peter Pan soon became his favorite story, and his grandmother read it to him every morning, while they had breakfast. His parents said that bedtime stories were, precisely, to sleep, but Leo insisted that they had to feed his spirit early in the morning so he would dream awake of flying.</p>
        <p align="justify"> <br> Sphyrna continued to grow and learn. From his parents, the value of effort and perseverance. From his grandmother, her philosophy and her values, those that only people who have gone through the worst and have forgiven know. From the farm animals, the ephemerality of life and the intensity that is needed if you want to eat. From the other children of the village, the loyalty of friendship. Of course he was not aware of this, but he was permeating the best that his environment had to offer.</p>

        <h3>Hoops</h3>
        <img src="https://c0.wallpaperflare.com/preview/429/461/301/red-basketball-on-grass-field.jpg">
      <p align="justify"> <br> The holographic players had not yet arrived in Brazil, but one of his friends had a television, and during the summer they spent whole days watching the SBA stars face each other, paying special attention, how could it be otherwise, to the Seleção. Alex Calderón was his idol. His way of playing was different. An omnipotent base, capable of scoring, assisting, defending and a better rebounder than many men bigger than himself.</p>
        <P align="justify"> <br> Inspired by the fury of that team, Sphyrna and his friends made a hoop with interlocking wires, and Lucas, moved, helped them hook it to a log and built a board for them. They were playing with a soccer ball for a long time, until the parents of all the children came together to buy them a regulation basketball. It was the happiest day in the life of those children. The routine was simple: they saw the likes of Calderón, Silva, Lamont, Gaucho and company fight like beasts for victory and studied their movements, and when the game was over, they went to the basket and practiced them. It felt like they were in the stadium and there were thousands of people cheering for their baskets.</P>

      <h3>Misfortune</h3>
      <img src="https://www.itl.cat/pngfile/big/17-177280_more-alone-boys-and-sad-guys-pictures-for.jpg">
      <p align="justify"> <br> Leo died when Sphyrna was only 15 years old, from tuberculosis. He had already experienced the death of farm animals and pets, and even a boy from the town had been taken by the river a few years ago, but they were not close friends. He had never experienced it so closely as now, and it hurt so much. His only consolation was the message she had given him the day before and only now was he allowed to read. "Don't cry for me, my love, that will hurt more than anything. My time has come, but I have lived fast and strong, I have had time to do everything I wanted and I have had a happy life. Live fast and live intensely, Sphyrna. Follow your dreams. Never stop doing it, because in that persecution is the secret. Always look ahead with determination. And be good, my life. I know you will be very good. My little star. I love you.”</p>

      <h3>To the SBDL</h3>
      <img src="https://c0.wallpaperflare.com/preview/832/496/11/brazil-state-of-minas-gerais-sports-basketball.jpg">
      <p align="justify"> <br> Sphyrna's fire burned more than any other. His intensity was unmatched, and his tenacity was eternal, and that was because the young Brazilian, son of the poor peasant Lucas Mokarran, had decided to play in the SBA. He knew he could do it, but only with an immense vocation and dedicating himself fully to it.</p>
    <p align="justify"> <br> He started playing on the local team, and soon caught the attention of scouts from Porto Alegre thanks to his ability to direct the team's game and his charisma, palpable on the court. However, he refused to abandon his companions. He kept working on his skills and physique day and night, watching videos and trying to replicate professional movements. He was the first Rio Pardo player to be chosen for the national team, even if it was for the U17 team, and it was there, in a tournament with the Selecao, where the General Manager of the Elgin Empire, MMFlex, noticed him and offered him a position on the team. This was an irrefutable offer.</p>

      <p align="justify"> <br> A season has passed in Elgin and Sphyrna has not stopped improving. Who knows how far it can go. One thing is clear...</p>
      <p align="justify"> <br> He will not stop trying until he achieves his dream. He can't. Four years ago he made a promise that no one heard.</p>
